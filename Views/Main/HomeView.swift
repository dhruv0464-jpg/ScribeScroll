            Most app sessions begin unconsciously. A small pause changes the whole session: what am I here to do in the next ten minutes?

            That question restores agency. Suddenly, scrolling becomes a choice with boundaries, not a default with no end state.

            Intentional use does not mean never relaxing. It means deciding before the feed decides for you.
